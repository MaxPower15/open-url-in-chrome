# Open URL in Chrome

This is an AppleScript that's designed to be used with Raycast. It's a quick way to focus a specific window+tab in Chrome. For example, you can use it with https://chatgpt.com if you prefer to access the interface via the browser instead of the native app.

## ChatGPT in Chrome setup

```
git clone https://github.com/MaxPower15/open-url-in-chrome.git
```

After that, just add open-url-in-chrome/raycast-scripts to your Raycast Scripts directories: `CMD+,` to bring up Extension Settings, then `CMD+N` to add something new.
